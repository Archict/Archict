## Start locally

You have 2 choices

1. Use the `docker-compose.yml` file. It will launch a container listening on port 8080. This container is static and
   doesn't allow you to see your modifications (prefer to use it for production).
2. Run `php -S localhost:8080 -t ./public` in a terminal. It will launch the script locally on port 8080. This one is
   dynamic and recommended for development environment.
